# Teacozy

A project from Codecademy where you are given a wireframe, the logo and images - the task is to recreate the wireframe however you like. 

This is an unresponsive template, as per the instructions given. The header area uses simple block positioning with floats to produce a fixed header.

The main image has opacity, which is an attempt to try and soften the bright colours against the black background design. The full width headline is striking over this.

The image cards use flexbox to position these in an inline-flex arrangement. Captions are displayed underneath.

The final location section again uses flexbox in a separate container overlying the image.
